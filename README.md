## Introduction

Web applications are often targets for various types of attacks. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure applications. This repository provides practical examples of common web vulnerabilities, including:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Security Misconfigurations

Each example is implemented using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

1. **SQL Injection**: Demonstrates how attackers can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to data.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Shows how malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Illustrates how unauthorized commands can be transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Explains how attackers can access resources by modifying the URL.
5. **Security Misconfigurations**: Highlights common misconfigurations that can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started
